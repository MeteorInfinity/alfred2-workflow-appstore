## Update to v2.0

The Alfred workflow for Searching in AppStore( or Mac App Store) now update to v2.0!

In this time, I rewrote workflow with python(v2.7). The most Importantly is the new workflow can detect your OS local settings to switch different region to search, and show results with your language.

I hope you will enjoy this. And welcome to report issues or your suggestions.

Thanks!
